This is an ***automated*** patch for the switch to helpers 2.1

If you are not familar with helpers 2.1, please check the discussion at https://forum.yunohost.org/t/new-experimental-2-1-helpers/30114

Please bear in mind that this is just an **automated** patch and it is very likely to not work out of the box.

In particular it is known to possibly create syntax issues or permission issues which may need to be resolved manually. You are absolutely encouraged to come discuss about this on the app packaging room if you are unsure how to fix a specific issue.
