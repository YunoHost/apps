This is an ***automated*** patch to add the (optional but recommended if relevant) Common PlatformÂ Enumeration (CPE) id, which is sort of a standard id for applications, defined by the NIST.

In particular, Yunohost may use this is in the future to easily track CVE (=security reports) related to apps.

The CPE may be obtained by searching here: https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search. For example, for Nextcloud, the CPE is 'cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud' (no need to include the version number)").
